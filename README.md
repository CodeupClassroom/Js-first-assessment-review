# JavaScript Second Assessment Review


## Instructions

0. *Carefully* read *all* the instructions and problems before beginning your work.

1. Clone this repository to your local projects directory.

2. Write your solutions to the problems presented below inside `solutions.js`.


## Problems

1. A farmer is asking you to tell him how many legs can be counted among all his animals. The farmer breeds three species:

   > chickens = 2 legs 
   > 
   > cows = 4 legs
   > 
   > pigs = 4 legs
   
   The farmer has counted his animals, and he gives you a subtotal for each species. You have to implement a function named `animal` that returns the total number of legs of all the animals.
   


2. Define a function named `findPerimeter` that takes in length and width and finds the perimeter of a rectangle.



3. Define a function named `concatName`. Given two strings, firstName and lastName, return a single string in the format "last, first".


4. Write a function named `triArea` that takes in 2 inputs, the base and height of a triangle and return its area.


5. Define a function named `lessThan100`. Given two numbers, return true if the sum of both numbers is less than 100. Otherwise return false.
        

6. Write a function named `makesTen` that takes two inputs. Both arguments are integers, a and b. Return true if one of them is 10 or if their sum is 10.


7. You are counting points for a basketball game, given the amount of 2-pointers scored and 3-pointers scored, create a function named `points` that will find the final points for the team and return that value.


8. Define a function named `Convert` that takes in minutes as an input and will converts those minutes into seconds.


9. Write a function named `remained` that takes two numbers as inputs. The first parameter divided by the second parameter will have a remainder, possibly zero. Return that value.


10. Write a function named `getFisrtValue` that takes an array containing only numbers and return the first element.
